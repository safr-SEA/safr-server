# SAFR

## Description
Our ultimate goal is to use crime and police response time data (data.seattle.gov API)  to allow people to discover places that are underserved by municipalities in terms of police response times. This allows the public to start a conversation about potential improvements and empowers residents and visitors to make informed decisions about their safety.

To be able to stay within the time constraints of this final project, we are starting with loading the 911 calls that had officer responses and map those locations using Google Maps. This does not yet incluce the response time.

## Getting Started
* Used the .eslintrc.json and the .gitignore from the class repo
* Used the normalize.css rules that we've used in class
* We each got personal keys for the data.seattle.gov's API
* We are using Google Maps free API which allows up to 1,000 calls daily.

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for using this program.

## Built With
This was built using JavaScript, jQuery, PostgresQL, HTML, and CSS.  We also used Node.js, Express, SuperAgent, and two different API's as discussed above.
